## What is BMI?

The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure of body fat based on height and weight that applies to adult men and women. Regarding the BMI measure, the World Health Organization (WHO) proposes the following classification:
* BMI < 18.5       : Underweight
* BMI [18.5-24.9]  : Normal weight
* BMI [25-29.9]    : Overweight
* BMI >= 30        : Obesity

## How it is calculated?
There is a formula for calculating the BMI measure. The formula is the following:

BMI = weight(kg) / height(metres)$^2$

Thus for example, the BMI will be:

```{r }
weight=65
height=1.65
BMI<-weight / height^2
BMI
```

## Diagnostic
The function use for calculating the diagnostic is the following:
```{r }
diagnostic_f<-function(weight,height){
        BMI_value<-weight/(height^2)
        ifelse(BMI_value<18.5,"underweight",ifelse(BMI_value<25,"normal weight",ifelse(BMI_value<30,"overweight","obesity")))
}
```

For our example (weight=65 kg and height=1.65 m) the diagnostic would be:
```{r }
diagnostic_f(65,1.65)

```

## Conclusion
The BMI is a relatively easy, cheap and non-invasive method for establishing weight status, and for most people, it correlates reasonably well with their level of body fat. 

However, BMI is only a proxy for body fatness. other factors such as fitness, ethnic origin and puberty can alter the relation between BMI and body fatness and must be taken into consideration.
